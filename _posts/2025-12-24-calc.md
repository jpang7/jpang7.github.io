Today I reviewed some concepts from Hubbard's book:

What 1D Newton's method is (at each iteration, take tangent of function and
follow it until it hits the x-axis.)

Inverse function theorem on Rn -> Rn functions. (If derivative at a point is
invertible, the function is locally invertible with differentiable inverse.
Hubbard wants you to shrink the radius of the neighborhood until a Lipschitz
condition on the derivative is satisfied.)

Lipschitz condition and ratio. f is lipschitz on an open set if
`|f(u)-f(v)| <= |u-v|` on that set for all u,v in the set. A speed limit on the
function.
