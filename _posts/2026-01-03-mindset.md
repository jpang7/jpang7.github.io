I want to think independently and be more willing to challenge existing
thoughts. If I don't do that, in a way, I feel like I'm not living my best life.

This requires help from many "faculties of the mind"-- energy to keep evaluating
new information, even if there's subtlety. Courage to contest other people's
thoughts even if its not pleasant. And energy to not only calculate what I think
is right or wrong, but also to translate my thoughts into speech that's kind and
understandable.

This is related to the stereotype of big tech-- golden handcuffs, big salary,
complacent, comfortable, a small cog in the machine. Some people leave because
they feel devoid of meaning. I could relate-- I wanted to do more meaningful
work. I thought founding a startup would be cool because it would be my own
brainchild.

I was dissatisfied with something, but couldn't identify it until now. I was
bummed out about:

- Not being confident in my own logic
- Self-limiting the scope of my thoughts to my immediate tasks

I should be more willing to ask-- "does this have to be this way?" Instead of
just accepting it. Especially when studying or ramping up. When I'm studying,
I'm too busy trying to understand what someone else is thinking. I drown out my
own thoughts.

And I should pay more attention to what people complain about. And work more and
interact with more people at work.
