I have a vague idea about what the implicit function theorem is about.

You have a system of equations and want to see when that system implicitly
defines an explicit function mapping n variables to m variables, at least near a
certain point. The condition has to do with the differentiability of the
derivative at that point I think.

Skipping ahead. Hubbard 3.1 discusses manifolds.

We want to define functions on interesting sets, and use calculus ---

I'm not very motivated. Not sure what the point of all of this is.

Still don't know -- why do we need to study manifolds? Do engineers work with
manifolds? No, apparently they work with parametrizations.

This is where my inexperience with multivariable calculus hurts.

Ok, whatever, say you want to "do calculus" e.g. examine the curvature of a
shell. The shell "is" a set of points, the graph of some function `f: R2 -> R1`

Left incomplete.
